# Match & Munch

A cross-platform mobile app that lets two users swipe right (yes) or left (no) on movie and food cards (like Tinder), then matches the items they both liked.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo)** - Mobile app framework
- **Firebase** - Authentication and Firestore database
- **TMDB API** - Movie data
- **Spoonacular API** - Food data
- **react-native-deck-swiper** - Card swipe interface

## üß© Features

### Authentication
- Anonymous sign-in using Firebase Auth

### Session Matching
- Create a session with a unique 6-character code
- Join a session using the code
- Store session data in Firestore

### Swipe Interface
- Swipe through movies (TMDB API)
- Swipe through food options (Spoonacular API)
- Store responses in Firestore

### Match Logic
- Compare "yes" responses from both users
- Find overlapping items in both categories
- Display all matched pairs

### Results Screen
- Card-style layout showing (movie, food) matches
- Share results with friends
- Start a new session

## üì± App Flow

1. **Home Screen**: Create or join a session
2. **Swipe Screen**: Swipe through movies, then foods
3. **Results Screen**: View matched movie and food combinations
